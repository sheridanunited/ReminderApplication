#Task Reminder Application

This is a simple application that can be used to schedule tasks. It uses Twilio to sent text messages and phone calls to the users. The application saves the task's description, user's details etc. It then builds a XML file and uploads it to a server using Rebex. Twilio's text to voice engine uses this XML file to play the audio message that the user hears during the phone call.
